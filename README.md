# Binary Translator for IA32 Architecture

This project was created as part of My Coursework for System Security and Binary Code Analysis. The project delved into below details.

- Developed a binary translator and runtime profiler for the IA-32 architecture, enabling dynamic instruction decoding,
patching, and runtime instrumentation for enhanced program analysis.
- Engineered a control flow management system, tracking basic block execution and dynamically modifying control flow
to maintain correctness during instrumentation.
- Designed a runtime profiling framework to collect and analyze function execution data, generating Control Flow
Graphs (CFGs) to visualize execution paths and optimize performance.
- Demonstrated the tool's capabilities on real-world examples, providing actionable insights into code behavior and
execution efficiency.

The full project is implemented in Part-5. Refer to README-3,4,5.md for the compilation and execution of the project.
